# MathematicaUtilities

An experimental physicist's aid in data analysis using Mathematica.

The core of the package is dedicated to operations on lists of the form `{{x1, y1}, {x2, y2}, ...}` (named `XYLists`), a natural format for many kinds of experimental and numerical simulation data.

Tested with Mathematica 11.0

## Installation

To use this package, the "utilities.m" file and the "Utilities" folder of this repo should be reachable from the Mathematica `$Path`. One way to arrange this is to download the repo content into a local folder, e.g. "C:\\...\\MathematicaUtilities", and add the following command to the Mathematica initialization file `$UserBaseDirectory`\Kernel\init.m:
```Mathematica
Module[{dirname},
	dirname="C:\\...\\MathematicaUtilities";
	If[!MemberQ[$Path,dirname],PrependTo[$Path,dirname]]
]
```
This will automatically make the package reachable on every startup.

Alternatively, a simpler solution is just to keep the "Utilities" folder in the same folder as the Mathematica notebook that uses it.

## Getting started

Suppose that there is a data table - an oscilloscope trace in this example - that is saved in a txt file like this
```
# Time (s) Voltage (V)
-0.010000000 4.396614e-05
-0.009997395 4.396614e-05
...
```
Below there are a few illustrations of what can be done with it using the functions in the package. Loading the package and the trace is done as

```Mathematica
SetDirectory[NotebookDirectory[]];
<< Utilities.m

xylist = Import[".\\Example data\\1. cavity transmission 1.txt", 
    "Table"][[2 ;;]];
```

Plotting the data over a certain range of x values
```Mathematica
ListPlot[SelectRange[data, {-0.004, 0.004}], defaultPlotFrameOptions, 
 PlotRange -> Full, Axes -> False, Joined -> True]
```
![SelectRange](Img/SelectRange.png)

Rescaling the data along the x axis and subtracting an offset along the y axis
```Mathematica
ScaleX[ShiftY[data, -0.1], 10^4]
```
(both the scale and the offset can also be `XYList`s, in which case the functions apply their y values, while their x values are assumed to be the same those of `data`).

Peak finding
```Mathematica
FindPeaksXY[xylist, 1, 0, 0.06]
{{0.00029427, 0.11662688377599999}}
```

Area integration under both small peaks
```Mathematica
IntegrateXY[data, {{-0.002, -0.0018}, {0.002, 0.0025}}]
7.14425*10^-7
```

To see help for a function, use `??` command, such as
```Mathematica
?? ScaleX
```

## General overview

The most commonly useful functions in my experience are 

- `ScaleY`, `ScaleX`, `ShiftY` and `ShiftX` can rescale a list of xy data in X and Y directions and shift the origin in a single command. 
 
- `SelectRange` – pick data points which x values belong to a certain range. Also the lower-level function `InRangeQ` that it uses is useful per se.
- `IntegrateXY` – a routine that efficiently integrates y(x) represented as a xy list and nicely handles arbitrary x boundaries and disjoined intervals (say, x ranging from 1 to 1.5 *and*  2 to 2.5)
- `Average` – performs a running average of an xy list with subsequent downsampling. It takes care so that the averaging region is always centered around the corresponding downsampled x values.

- `FindLogFit` – Fitting on log scale. Can be used to make fitting more robust when the magnitude of data in one trace spans several different scales.
- `ThreadFindFit` – threads a fitting function over a list of xylists, possibly restricting to the x values within a certain interval.
- `LoadDataSeries` – loads files that have parameters in their name (say "spectrum_power_x_mW.txt") and returns data vs parameter
- Test patterns can be also useful, for example see `FunctionQ` or `XYListQ`.

These functions are typically automatically threaded over lists of xy traces.
 
The plotting package includes the definitions of a few gradient color sets (e.g. `redColors` and `blueColors`). These gradients are handy for quickly beautifying plots. Also there are:
- `ListPlotJ` – a family of functions that plot discrete data points and lines that join them at the same time. This is a surprisingly annoying thing to implement in Mathematica. 
- `PlotExplorer`  - a function that makes Mathematica plots interactive by adding zoom capabilities. Can be slow for large datasets. 

## Sub-packages

* `DataAnalysis` - Functions operating with lists of `{x, y}` and `{x, y, z}` data, data matching patterns, fitting routines, batch data analysis etc.
* `CellReuse` - Functions for copying Mathematica cells with replacing name tags. Enables reusing once-written code for diffrent input data while keeping all variables simultaneously in the global scope.
* `Plotting` - Color lists, plotting options and a few plotting functions beyond the Mathematica standard catalog. 
* `Fourier` - High-level routines for performing Discrete Fourier Transform on `XYList`s. 
* `FemTools` - Function for importing and processing data generated by COMSOL (such as tables with results of parametric sweeps), and efficient integration routines for functions defined on 2D triangular and 3D tetrahedral meshes.
 
 ## Applications

For application examples one is invited to have a look at the repos with the data and data processing notebooks for our manuscripts

* [Quantum Correlations of Light from a Room-Temperature Mechanical Oscillator](https://zenodo.org/records/854557)
* [Elastic strain engineering for ultralow mechanical dissipation](https://zenodo.org/records/10927399)

MathematicaUtilities are also used in [Euler-Bernoulli beam](https://zenodo.org/record/1296925#.YVon7ZqxVPY).

## Implementation remarks

Most of the .m packages are not to be edited directly, but using the companion .nb files with
the same name, from which they were generated. Each time the .nb file is saved, .m file is automatically replaced with a 
new one, thus discarding any changes made in the .m file directly. This system is followed because notebooks allow 
reacher formatting and embedding images, which is very useful for illustrating complex mathematical formulas.

Those .m files that do not have associated .nb files with the same name can be edited directly.
